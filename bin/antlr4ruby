=begin rdoc antlr4ruby

A simple wrapper script to run the ANTLR tool with the ruby antlr3
target modifications in place of the default Ruby target data.
It essentially does two things:

* locate the `customized' ANTLR v.3 JAR archive file
* exec the command <tt>java -cp path/to/jar $ARGV</tt>

Thus, for ANTLR tool usage, refer to ANTLR's main documentation
at http://www.antlr.org .

There are a small number of additional options available
in addition to ANTLR's options:

  --version         display the Ruby target version and then the
                    ANTLR tool's version information
  
  --help, -h        as ANTLR does not provide these standard switches,
                    it executes the ANTLR tool without arguments to make
                    it print out usage information
                    
  --keep-classpath  Do not unset the CLASSPATH environmental variable before
                    executing the java command (*)


(*) This script unsets CLASSPATH to avoid interference from system installations
    of prior versions of ANTLR. The jar that is distributed with this package
    is complete, and thus does not generally require any external libraries, so
    this shouldn't cause any major problems. However, if for some reason you
    need to keep this variable to execute the command properly, you can use
    the --keep-classpath option.
